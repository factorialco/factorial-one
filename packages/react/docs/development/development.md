## Install nodejs

The recommended approach is to use the `asdf` dependency manager. On MacOS +
Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install asdf
$ echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${
```

Then open a new terminal:

```bash
$ asdf plugin add nodejs
```

Then, `cd` into the project's directory and:

```bash
$ asdf install
```

This should leave you with a fully working nodejs version.

### Start the project

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run the storybook server:

```bash
$ npm start
```
