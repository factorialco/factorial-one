         *
         * If a token in `redef` also appears in the copied language, then the existing token in the copied language
         * will be overwritten at its original position.
         *
         * ## Best practices
         *
         * Since the position of overwriting tokens (token in `redef` that overwrite tokens in the copied language)
         * doesn't matter, they can technically be in any order. However, this can be confusing to others that trying to
         * understand the language definition because, normally, the order of tokens matters in Prism grammars.
         *
         * Therefore, it is encouraged to order overwriting tokens according to the positions of the overwritten tokens.
         * Furthermore, all non-overwriting tokens should be placed after the overwriting ones.
         *
         * @param {string} id The id of the language to extend. This has to be a key in `Prism.languages`.
         * @param {Grammar} redef The new tokens to append.
         * @returns {Grammar} The new language created.
         * @public
         * @example
         * Prism.languages['css-with-colors'] = Prism.languages.extend('css', {
         *     // Prism.languages.css already has a 'comment' token, so this token will overwrite CSS' 'comment' token
         *     // at its original position
         *     'comment': { ... },
         *     // CSS doesn't have a 'color' token, so this token will be appended
         *     'color': /\b(?:red|green|blue)\b/
         * });
         */

        /**
         * Inserts tokens _before_ another token in a language definition or any other grammar.
         *
         * ## Usage
         *
         * This helper method makes it easy to modify existing languages. For example, the CSS language definition
         * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded
         * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the
         * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do
         * this:
         *
         * ```js
         * Prism.languages.markup.style = {
         *     // token
         * };
         * ```
         *
         * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens
         * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:
         *
         * ```js
         * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {
         *     'style': {
         *         // token
         *     }
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * ## Special cases
         *
         * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar
         * will be ignored.
         *
         * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:
         *
         * ```js
         * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {
         *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,
         *     // tokens after 'comment'
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * ## Limitations
         *
         * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object
         * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave
         * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily
         * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.
         *
         * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.
         * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This
         * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.
         *
         * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if
         * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.
         *
         * ```js
         * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;
         * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });
         *
         * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);
         * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);
         * ```
         *
         * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the
         * object to be modified.
         * @param {string} before The key to insert before.
         * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.
         * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the
         * object to be modified.
         *
         * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.
         * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.
