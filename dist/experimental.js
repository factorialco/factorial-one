   * If a token is specified, that state will emit that token when reached by
   * the linkify engine.
   *
   * If no state exists, it will be initialized with some default transitions
   * that resemble existing default transitions.
   *
   * If a state is given for the second argument, that state will be
   * transitioned to on the given input regardless of what that input
   * previously did.
   *
   * Specify a token group flags to define groups that this token belongs to.
   * The token will be added to corresponding entires in the given groups
   * object.
