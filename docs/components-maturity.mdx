# Maturity Model

Explaining the difference between stable and experimental components

## TLDR

<div className="grid grid-cols-[auto_1fr]">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center bg-f1-background-critical p-4">
    Playground
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal only, not part of the public API.</li>
    <li>No stability or rules; for internal experimentation.</li>
    <li>Use: Internal testing and prototyping only.</li>
  </ul>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center bg-f1-background-warning p-4">
    Experimental
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Unstable API and design, subject to frequent changes.</li>
    <li>
      No guarantee of backward compatibility; does not follow semantic
      versioning.
    </li>
    <li>Exported from `@factorialco/factorial-one/experiment`</li>
    <li>Use: Prototyping and non-critical projects, with caution.</li>
  </ul>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center bg-f1-background-positive p-4">
    Stable
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Production-ready, fully tested.</li>
    <li>API and design are stable; follows semantic versioning.</li>
    <li>Backward-compatible; breaking changes occur only in major releases.</li>
    <li>Exported from the root of `@factorialco/factorial-one`</li>
    <li>Use: Safe for all production projects.</li>
  </ul>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center bg-f1-background-info p-4">
    Deprecated
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Obsolete; will be removed in the next major version.</li>
    <li>Has better alternatives; not actively maintained.</li>
    <li>
      Use: Avoid in new projects, and migrate existing usage to newer
      components.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Experimental → Stable

Experimental components may become stable once tested and feedback is incorporated.
The Factorial One team provides the migration guide in case of API changes during the promotion.

The promotion happens when an experimental component completes the checklist:
- The component meets design requirements
- All features and edge cases implemented
- Composable API provided
- The component has screenshot and unit tests
- The component is responsive
- Accessibility requirements are met on the AA level
- Documentation page has description and use cases together with stories
